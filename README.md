# Overview

For this project, I wanted to get more comfortable writing real, functional code in Kotlin. I created a password manager that lets users store, view, search, and delete login credentials using simple user input. This helped me explore how Kotlin handles data classes, collections, and conditional logic in a practical way. My goal was to better understand Kotlin syntax while building something useful.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE and installed the Kotlin compiler to run my program from the terminal. I used basic Kotlin libraries that come with the language, no external dependencies were needed.

# Future Work


- Let users update existing credentials
- Add password strength checking
- Store credentials in a file so they persist after closing the app
